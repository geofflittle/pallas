//! The Leios endorsement layer, from a follower's side of the wire.
//!
//! On a Leios network most transactions never appear in a ranking block. A
//! ranking block header announces an endorser block, a later ranking block
//! certifies that announcement, and the certified endorser block carries the
//! transactions. A follower that reads only the ranking chain builds a ledger
//! that is silently short.
//!
//! The endorser block body is a network object rather than a ledger one. Its
//! rule is
//!
//! ```cddl
//! endorser_block = { * hash => word32 }
//! ```
//!
//! from the node to node `leios-fetch` CDDL of cardano-blueprint on the
//! `leios-prototype` branch, `src/network/node-to-node/leios-fetch/messages.cddl`,
//! quoted verbatim in the conformance test in
//! `pallas-network2/src/protocol/leiosfetch.rs`. It is absent from the Dijkstra
//! ledger CDDL, which carries only `eb_announcement`, `leios_certificate` and
//! the two header fields.
//!
//! Three properties of that wire form each cost a follower its ledger if it
//! guesses, so every one of them is carried in a type here rather than left to
//! a caller.
//!
//! 1. The protocol has no not found reply. An endorser block the peer does not
//!    hold comes back as `a0`, a well formed empty body, indistinguishable from
//!    one that committed no transactions. The announcement commits the body
//!    length before any fetch, so
//!    [`crate::leios::EndorserBlockBody::decode_announced`] is the constructor
//!    that pairs the two and refuses a length the announcement did not promise.
//! 2. The body keys a transaction by the blake2b-256 of the whole transaction,
//!    not by its transaction id, which is the blake2b-256 of the body alone. A
//!    follower that looks for transaction ids finds nothing, with no error.
//! 3. Each transaction arrives wrapped in a CBOR byte string, and the length in
//!    the body is the length of the unwrapped transaction.
//!
//! The certification rule needs nothing but ranking chain headers. Walk them in
//! order, carry the most recent announcement forward, and when a header sets
//! `block_body_contains_leios_cert` the carried announcement is the endorser
//! block to fetch and apply at that header's block. An announcement superseded
//! before any block certifies it is abandoned network wide.
//! [`crate::leios::CertificationTracker`] is that walk.
//!
//! The links above are written in full because this module carries an inner
//! doc block and `lib.rs` carries an outer one on its `mod` line. The two are
//! merged, and a bare item name in the merged text is looked for in the crate
//! root rather than here.
